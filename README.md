## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a virtual Aquarius as a platform from which a future Z80-based hobbyist computer can be developed. Below are a list of possible future enhancements:
* Paged RAM in four banks (size to be determined)
* Reworked SYSROM and programmable CHARROM
* Integrated USB drive port and commands (remove dependence on cassette loading)
* Modern, flexible video solution that supports bitmapped graphics, sprites, and tiles, delivered through clean VGA or HDMI output
* Ability to have two or more AY sound chips for additional voices and control inputs
