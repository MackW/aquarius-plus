# Aquarius+
Next-generation Z80-based retro computer system

## Abstract:
What would the Aquarius have evolved into if Mattel hadn't abandoned the system back in 1984? The Aquarius+ is the next-generation of Z80-based 8-bit hardware for the Aquarius platform. The intent is to deliver a cost-effective, backwards-compatible retro computer system that both developers and nostalgists will love and use, all in the spirit of the original, orphaned Aquarius platform.

## Features:
* Backward compatibility with existing Aquarius software library
* Modern, flexible video solution that supports bitmapped graphics, sprites, and tiles, delivered through clean VGA output
* Ability to have two or more AY sound chips for additional voices and control inputs
* 512kb of paged RAM in four 16k banks
* Reworked SYSROM and programmable CHARROM
* Integrated SD card and commands (remove dependence on cassette loading)
* WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities
