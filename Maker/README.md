**Maker's Guide to Manufacturing an Aquarius+**

## Abstract:

This folder contains all the items necessary for a Maker to manufacture and assemble an Aquarius+ computer. For simplicity, this guide is currently geared towards using [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com). Other vendors can absolutely be used, but this is the easiest path we have found.

## Overview of the Manufacturing Process:

1. Order the parts.
2. Order the assembled PCBs.
3. Assemble the Aquarius+.
