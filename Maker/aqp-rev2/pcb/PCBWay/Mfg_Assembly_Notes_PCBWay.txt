Please confirm the following items after assembly:
- In a few instances, resistors R7 - R21 in the VGA RGB ladder have occasionally been placed misaligned and disconnected, causing color issues. Visually inspect ALL SMT components for proper placement, alignment, and attachment. 
- Ensure J7 expansion port is in the right two rows of holes. There should be an empty row of pins on the left.
- Verify Micro USB Power connector J1 mounting lugs are properly attached
- Verify SD card J9 pin 11 (upper left) is properly connected
- Verify LED D3 cathode is in the left hole (GND)
- On LED D3, fold the LED forward at a right angle
